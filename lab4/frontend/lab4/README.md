For this lab, I focused on using Angular as a tool to implement the HTML files using Angular components and modules. With the REST API from lab 3, I could use backend side server NodeJS to retrieve a specific movie's information from the external API database. The difficult part about this lab personally was getting the frontend with angular done right, such as building the component typescripts. I also had a hard time implementing the form correctly, as the input value would not be saved into the component variables. I figured how to solve this by using ngForm, a built in angular form.

I could not upload a security report because the installation would just not work.
