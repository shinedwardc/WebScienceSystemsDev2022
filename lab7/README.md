To give a brief explanation of the bar chart, this chart's y axis has the number of votes the movie has in imdb, and the x axis represents the according movie's title.
The scatter chart shows the relationship with the number of votes increases depending on how recently the movie came out.
For this lab, I got stuck with figuring out the right type for the data array, as for the drawBars function needs to input an array. I originally had the data variable
as an object. I also had trouble with setting the right attributes for the labels/values, and centering/aligning the text also needed work as well, so I changed the 
transform, translate values. I editted the range and domain values to fit with the range context of the charts.
