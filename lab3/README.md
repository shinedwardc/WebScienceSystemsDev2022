# Reflection
For this lab, I used an API from omdbapi, which provides a movie's information and ratings. 
With node javascript, I could make an internal REST API to parse json information of a specific movie and send the result to the frontend. </br>
When the user inputs a movie title and hits the submit button, the frontend makes a fetch request. I put in the paramater movie/title=(title name), which is sent as a request to the side server, which in server.js I could parse the wanted movie's information such as the year it was released, genre, plot, etc in json format.
Personally, this lab was really difficult because I had a hard time understanding request and result, as it was my first time utilizing node and express. I struggled to find the right method pipeline for designing the API. I resolved the main issues by getting help from my group teammates, and referenced to the group project last friday.</br>
